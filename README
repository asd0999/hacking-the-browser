Homework for the Hacking the Browser class

Final project was a Chrome extension that throws an alert everytime a user re-uses the same password on different websites.
The passwords are stored locally as a salted hash!

Though my favourite extension is week 5's catgif which shows a cat gif everytime I open a new tab on the browser, lol
